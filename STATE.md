## In flight

Nothing in flight as of 2026-08-27.

## Blocked

Nothing blocked. Zero open PRs.

## Current release

Latest published: `v1.0.0` (verify directly — `gh api
repos/Ubiquex/ubx-schema-google/releases/tags/v1.0.0`). 524 members. Does NOT
carry a real `min_binary_version` yet — predates that field (UBI-194). A
pinned `[providers.google]` resolution falls back to `ubiquex`'s own
bootstrap table (`schema_format 3 -> ubx-provider-dynamic 1.0.0`), confirmed
working correctly and logging visibly. Deliberately not forced to
regenerate — recommendation on record (UBI-194) is this repo tracks a
fast-moving upstream API and is near-certain to bump for real content reasons
within a cycle or two of its own weekly `hash-watch.yml` cron anyway, picking
up `min_binary_version` for free at that point.

## Before touching anything

- Never self-merge here. See `CLAUDE.md`.
- `hash-watch.yml` now builds against a real, tagged `ubx-provider-dynamic`
  release (fixed UBI-194) — a regeneration today would carry a real
  `min_binary_version` if it runs.
